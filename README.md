# Commodore-64-USB-Keyboard .... oh, and Joystick!
An Arduino Micro firmware for making a C64 keyboard into a USB HID device. This uses the REAL keyboard key mapping of the C64, not the PC mapping. The joysticks become USB joystick devices.

# DJ's Looooong Live C64 Pi Hack
I hacked my original C64 from when I was younger... into raspberry pi C4 with ALL the games! ALL the disks!

# VICE Emulator
This is designed to work with the VICE emulator. That means the Commodore Key is shortcut for pressing F12, which brings up the menu. To access the ALT-W (warp mode) press CTRL-SHIFT-W

# Wiring
The source code has pinouts for the wiring of both the joysticks and keyboard.
